The file Assembly is for Rasbian ARM processors. It also has lots of comments explaining the code as well.

SELF REMINDER: HOW TO GIT PUSH

install git
git clone <repoAddr>					//repoAddr is the link to the git repository
git remote add <alias> <repoAddr> 			//alias is just a shortcut to call the url for git repository
git status 						//gives you info on the repo
git config --global user.name "<>"			//should not leave blank
git config --global user.email "<>"		 	//can leave blank
cd <filePath>						//moves to file folder path
git add <filename>					//adds the file to the repository
git commit						//commits the files in the local repository to prep for upload
git push [-u] <gitAlias | address> [branch]		//pushes the updated repository [-u] means push entire folder repository
sign into github account and continue


git config --global push.default upstream		
git branch --set-upstream-to origin/branchTest


git add --all						//adds all changes to local repo
